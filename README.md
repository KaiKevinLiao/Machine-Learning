This folders contains the my machine learning practice. It includes proof of important theorems and implemetations of commonly used machine learning algorithms, such as, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression, SVM, Statistical Learning Theory, Perception, Ridge Regression, Kernel Regression, KMeans, GMM, EM, Neural Networks, CNN, Kernel Density Estimation, and etc.

The codes are in Python (Jupyter Notebook). I uploaded the pdf version of them
